 And those who believed afterwards, that is, after the first believers and emigrants, and emigrated and strove with you — they are of you, O Muhājirūn and Ansār; and those related by blood, kinsmen, are nearer to one another, in terms of inheritance, than [those who share] inheritance on account of [their common] faith and emigration mentioned in the previous verse, according to the Book of God, the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh almahfūz). Truly God is Knower of all things, including the wisdom regarding [the rules of] inheritance. Medinese [entirely], or [Medinese] except for the last two verses ending with verse 130 [which are Meccan], or [Medinese] except for one verse. The basmala, ‘In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful’, does not preface this [sūra] because the Prophet (s) was not commanded to [recite] it [in this way], as may be understood from a hadīth reported by al-Hākim, in which he states [by way of an isnād] from ‘Alī that the basmala is [invoked] for ‘security’ (amān), whereas this [sūra] was revealed to remove security by way of the sword. According to [a hadīth related] by Hudhayfa [b. al-Yamān]: ‘You call it the sūra of Repentance, but it is actually the sūra of Chastisement (al-‘adhāb)’. Al-Bukhārī reported [by way of an isnād] from al-Barā’ [b. ‘Āzib] that this was the last sūra to be revealed.
