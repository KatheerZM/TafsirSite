 Whoever acts righteously, whether male or female, and is a believer, him verily We shall revive with a goodly life. This is said to be life in Paradise; or it is life on earth, [when it is] one of contentedness or one of wholesome (halāl) provision. And We shall surely pay them their reward according to the best of what they used to do.
