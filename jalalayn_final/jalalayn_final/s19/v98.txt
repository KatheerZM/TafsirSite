 And how many — in other words, many — a generation, namely, [how many] a community from among the communities of the past, We have destroyed before them, for their denial of [Our] messengers. Can you see, [can] you find, [so much as] one of them, or hear from them [so much as] the faintest sound? No, indeed! So, just as We destroyed those [folk], We shall destroy these [Meccans]. Meccan, except for verses 130 and 131, which are Medinese; it consists of 135, 140 or 142 verses, revealed after [sūrat] Maryam.
