 God chooses from the angels messengers and [also chooses] from mankind, messengers â€” this was revealed after the idolaters said, Has the Remembrance been revealed to him out of [all of] us? [Q. 38:8]. Truly God is Hearer, of what they say, Seer, of those whom He chooses as messengers, such as Gabriel, Michael, Abraham, Muhammad (s) and others, may God bless them and grant them peace.
