 and verily [soon] he shall [himself] be pleased, with the reward he will be given in Paradise. The verse applies [equally] to anyone who may do as he [Abū Bakr] did, may God be pleased with him, and such [a person] will thereby be removed far from the Fire and rewarded. When this was revealed, the Prophet (s) said Allāhu akbar! at the end, and so it became the recommended practice (sunna) to say this at the end of it; it is also reported that it [the saying of it] is actually enjoined at the end of this [sūra] and at the end of every sūra henceforth, and that is [to say] Allāhu akbar or lā ilāha illā’Llāh wa’Llāhu akbar.
