 Say (qul, a variant reading has qāla, ‘He said’): ‘My Lord! Judge, between me and my deniers, with truth, by [assigning] chastisement for them or victory [for me] over them. And so they were chastised at [the battles of] Badr, Uhud, Hunayn, al-Ahzāb and al-Khandaq and he [the Prophet] was given victory over them. And our Lord is the Compassionate One, Whose help is to be sought against what you allege’, when you invent lies against God, saying that ‘[God] has taken a son’ [cf. Q. 2:116]; and against me, when you say, ‘[he is] a sorcerer’ [cf. Q. 38:4], or against the Qur’ān, when you say, ‘[it is] poetry’ [cf. Q. 52:30]. Medinese, except for verses 52, 53, 54 and 55, which were [revealed] between Mecca and Medina; it consists of 78 verses, revealed after [sūrat] al-Nūr.
