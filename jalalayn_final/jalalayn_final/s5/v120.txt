 To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, the storehouses of rain, vegetation, sustenance and everything else, and all that is in them (wa-mā fīhinna: the use of mā, ‘that’, indicates the predominance of all those non-rational creations); and He has power over all things, including the rewarding of the truthful and the punishing of the liar — He is specifically addressing rational beings, for there is none among them with power over all things. [Consists of] 165 verses, all Meccan except for 20, 23, 91, 93, 114, 141, 151, 152, 153, which are Medinese and which were revealed after [sūrat] al-Hijr.
