Imam Muslim narrates in his Sahih > Abeedullah ibn Umar Al-Qawariri > Yahya ibn Saeed > Abdul-Malik ibn Abi Sulaiman > Saeed ibn Jubair that Ibn Umar said:

The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) used to say prayer on his camel while coming from Mecca to Medina, in whatever direction his face had turned; and it was (in this context) that this verse was revealed, "So wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face of Allah." (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/6/43">Sahih Muslim</a>)

At-Tirmidhi recorded this hadith in his Book of Tafsir (<a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/739430">Jami Tirmidhi</a>), An-Nasai recorded it (<a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai/5/44">Sunan An-Nasai</a>), Imam Ahmad recorded it in his Musnad, and Ibn Jarir (At-Tabari) also recorded it. And At-Tirmidhi said it was a Hasan Sahih hadith.
