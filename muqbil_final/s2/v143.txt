Imam Bukhari says in the Book of Tafsir > Abu Naeem > Zuhair > Abu Ishaq > Al-Baraa'a (RA) that:

 The Prophet (ﷺ) prayed facing Bait-ul Maqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that his Qibla would be the Kaaba (at Mecca). So Allah Revealed (the verse 2:144) and he offered Asr prayers (in his Mosque facing Kaaba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. 
 
 A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, "I, (swearing by Allah,) testify that I have prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ) facing Mecca." 
 
 Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka`ba while they were still bowing. 
 
 Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Kaaba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed "And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith. Indeed Allah is, to the people, Kind and Merciful." (2:143) (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4486">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>)
 
Imam Bukhari also recorded this hadith in the Book of Iman (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:40">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>). And Hafiz Ibn Hajar says in Fath Al-Bari: In the book of Tafsir, from the path of Ath-Thawri from Abi Ishaq, he says "I heard from Al-Baraa'a," (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4492">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>) thus it is safe from what is feared of the tadlees of Abi Ishaq.

In addition, Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi and Ibn Saad recorded it. Ibn Jarir recorded it as well, from both the narrations of Al-Baraa'a (RA) and Ibn Abbas (RA).

From the narrations of Ibn Abbas (RA), Tirmidhi recorded it grading it Hasan Sahih (<a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/739530">Jami At-Tirmidhi</a>), Abu Dawud recorded it (<a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4680">Sunan Abi Dawud</a>), At-Tayalisi recorded it, and Al-Hakim recorded it saying it is Sahih in chain and Adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.
