Imam Bukhari says in his Sahih > Abu al-Yaman > Shoaib > Az-Zuhri > Urwah (RA) that he asked Aisha (RA) and said: Don't you see Allah's statement "Indeed, as-Safa and al-Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs Umrah - there is no blame upon him for walking between them (i.e. doing Sa'ee)"? So, by Allah, there is no blame on anyone if he does not do tawaf (i.e. Sa'ee) between Safa and Marwa (during Umrah).

She responded: 

O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, "there is no blame upon him for NOT walking between them (i.e. doing Sa'ee)." 

But, in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume Ihram for worshipping an idol called "Manat" which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. 

When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, "O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." 

So Allah revealed: Indeed, as-Safa and al-Marwah are among the symbols of Allah

Aisha (RA) added: 

Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them." 

Later on I (Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin Abdur-Rahman (of Aisha's narration), and he said: 

I have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom Aisha mentioned and who used to assume Ihram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. 

When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Kaaba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Kaaba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' 

So Allah revealed: Indeed, as-Safa and al-Marwah are among the symbols of Allah

Abu Bakr said: 

It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre- Islamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Kaaba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Kaaba. (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1643">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>)

Bukhari also recorded the hadith without mentioning Abu Bakr ibn Abdur-Rahman and what he said (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1790">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4495">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>, and <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4861">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>). Imam Muslim recorded it as well (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1277a">Sahih Muslim</a>, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1277b">Sahih Muslim</a>, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1277c">Sahih Muslim</a>, and <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1277d">Sahih Muslim</a>). Imam Tirmidhi also recorded it and said "This is a Hasan Sahih hadith" (<a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/739540">Jami Tirmidhi</a>) and in it is the statement that the speaker of "Later on I told Abu Bakr" is Az-Zuhri, Abu Dawud recorded it without what Az-Zuhri said to Abu Bakr ibn Abdur-Rahman (RA) (<a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:1901">Sunan Abi Dawud</a>), and An-Nasai recorded it similar to what is with Abu Dawud (<a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:2967">Sunan An-Nasai</a>), Ibn Majah recorded it (<a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2986">Sunan Ibn Majah</a>), Imam Ahmad recorded it, Imam Malik recorded it in the Muwatta (<a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/508330">Muwatta Malik</a>), and Al-Humaidi recorded it.

Imam Bukhari recorded in his Sahih (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4496">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>), Imam Muslim recorded (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1278">Sahih Muslim</a>), and Tirmidhi recorded grading it as authentic (<a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/739550">Jami At-Tirmidhi</a>) on the authority of Anas (RA) that he was asked about Safa and Marwa, and he said:

We used to consider (i.e. going around) them a custom of the Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance, so when Islam came, we gave up going around them. Then Allah revealed: Indeed, as-Safa and al-Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs Umrah - there is no blame upon him for walking between them. (2:158) (End of Hadith)

And there is nothing preventing the verse from having been revealed about all of them.
