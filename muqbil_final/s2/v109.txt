Abu Shaykh Al-Asbahani says in his book of Al-Akhlaq > Ibn Abi Aasim > Amr ibn Uthman ibn Bashr ibn Saeed > his father > Az-Zuhri > Urwah > Usamah ibn Zaid that Saad informed him that: 

The Prophet (SAW) was riding on a donkey and said to him, "Haven't you heard what Abul-Habab (meaning Abdullah ibn Ubay) said? He said this and this."

Then, Saad said, "Excuse and forgive him," so the Prophet (SAW) excused him, for the Prophet (SAW) and his companions used to forgive the pagans and the People of the Book.

Thus, Allah revealed, "So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent."

The narrators of the hadith are strong. Ibn Abi Aasim is a great Hafiz (of hadith), his biography in Tazkirah Al-Huffaz. The rest are in Tahzeeb At-Tahzeeb. The hadith is also in the Sahih (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/65/88">see here</a>) from the path of Shuaib ibn Abu Hamzah with this chain, but the reason for revelation is not in the Sahih. And like that (without the reason for revelation being explicit) is in the Tafsir of Ibn Abi Hatim and in the Tafsir of Ibn Kathir.
