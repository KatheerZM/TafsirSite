Ibn Ishaq said > Aasim ibn Umar ibn Qatadah > some men from his tribe that, they said:

Among the things that drew us to Islam, in addition to the mercy of Allah and his guidance to us, was what we used to hear from Jewish people when we were idol-worshippers and the People of the Book used to have knowledge we did not have.

There constantly used to be trouble and enmity between us. Whenever we harmed them with something, they would say, "The time of the coming prophet is certainly nearing. At that time, we will kill you along with him like the killings of Aad and Iram." And we used to hear this a lot from them, so when Allah sent his Prophet (SAW) we responded to him when he called us to Allah and we recognized what they used to promise us.

We beat them in following him; we believed in him, and they disbelieved in him. Thus, the verses from Baqarah, "And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers," were revealed regarding us and them. (End of Hadith)

This is from the Seerah of Ibn Hisham and it is a Hasan hadith, because whenever Ibn Hisham declares a hadith, the hadith is Hasan as mentioned by Al-Hafiz Adh-Dhahabi in Al-Mizan.
