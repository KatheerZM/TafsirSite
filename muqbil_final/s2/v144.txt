Imam Bukhari says in his Sahih > Abdullah ibn Rajaa'a > Israil > Abu Ishaq > Al-Baraa'a ibn Azib that:

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed facing Bait ul-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen months but he loved to face the Kaaba (at Mecca) so Allah revealed: "We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O Muhammad], toward the heaven [...]" (2:144) 

So the Prophet (ﷺ) faced the Kaaba and the fools amongst the people namely "the Jews" said, "What has turned them from their Qibla (Baitul-Maqdis) which they formerly observed?"

(Allah revealed): Say, "To Allah belongs the east and the west. He guides whom He wills to a straight path." (2:142) 

A man prayed with the Prophet (facing the Kaaba) and went out. He saw some of the Ansar praying the Asr prayer with their faces towards Bait ul-Maqdis, and he said, "I bear witness that I prayed with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) facing the Kaaba." 

So all the people turned their faces towards the Ka`ba. (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:399">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>)

Tirmidhi recorded the hadith on this verse as well calling it Hasan Sahih (<a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:340">Jami At-Tirmidhi</a>), Ibn Majah recorded it including in his narration the reason for revelation of "And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith" (<a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah/5/208">Sunan Ibn Majah</a>), Imam Ahmad recorded it, Ad-Daruqtani recorded it, Ibn Hatim recorded it as in the Tafsir of Ibn Kathir, and Ibn Saad recorded it in At-Tabaqaat. With the last two, there was the addition of "Say: To Allah belongs the east and the west. He guides whom He wills to a straight path."

In addition, Imam Muslim recorded it from the narrations of Anas (RA) (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:527">Sahih Muslim</a>), and Ibn Saad has also recorded it like that.
