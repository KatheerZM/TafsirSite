Ibn Ishaq says > Ismail ibn Abi Khalid > Abu Ishaq > Baraa'a that he said:

The Prophet (SAW) used to pray in the direction of Bait-al-Muqaddas. And he increasedly looked at the sky waiting for Allah's command, so Allah revealed: "We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O Muhammad], toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased [...]" (2:144).

Then, some men from the Muslims said, "We wish we knew about the fate of those who died before we turned to the qiblah," so Allah sent down: "[...] And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith. [...]"

And, the foolish people said, "What has turned them away from their qiblah, which they used to face?" so Allah sent down: "The foolish among the people will say [...]" till the end of the verse.

This was taken from Lubaab An-Nuqool fee Asbaab An-Nuzool by Hafiz As-Suyuti and from the Tafsir of Hafiz Ibn Kathir.
