Imam Bukhari records in his Sahih > Amr ibn Awn > Hushaim > Humaid > Anas that Umar (RA) said:

My Lord agreed with me in three things:-

1. I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I wish we took the station of Abraham as our praying place (for some of our prayers). So came the Divine Inspiration: And take you (people) the station of Abraham as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers e.g. two rak`at of Tawaf of Ka`ba)". (2:125) 

2. And as regards the (verse of) the veiling of the women, I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I wish you ordered your wives to cover themselves from the men because good and bad ones talk to them.' So the verse of the veiling of the women was revealed. 

3. Once the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) made a united front against the Prophet (ﷺ) and I said to them, 'It may be if he (the Prophet) divorced you, (all) that his Lord (Allah) will give him instead of you wives better than you.' So this verse (the same as I had said) was revealed." (66:5). (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/8/53">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>)

Then, Imam Bukhari also mentioned it in his Book of Tafsir (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/65/10">Sahih al-Bukhari</a>) and in Yahya ibn Saad's examination of Hushaim. And in both places, he mentions him stating the hearing of Humaid from Anas (RA). Al-Hafiz (Ibn Hajar) says in Al-Fath (Al-Bari): So it is safe from his tadlees.

The hadith has also been recorded by Tirmidhi (<a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/739460">Jami At-Tirmidhi</a>), and he called it Hasan Sahih. It is from the ahadith of Umar (RA), and Tirmidhi stops the narration at the verse, "And take you (people) the station of Abraham [...]"

Hafiz Ibn Kathir, in his tafsir, attributes the hadith to An-Nasai and Ibn Majah (<a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah/5/207">Sunan Ibn Majah</a>) and recorded it himself. And At-Tabari as well recorded it similar to how it is in Tirmidhi.
