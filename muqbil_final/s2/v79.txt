Imam Bukhari narrated in his book "Khalq Af'al Al-'Ibad" > Yahya > Wakee' > Sufyan > Abdur-Rahman ibn Alqamah > that Ibn Abbas said: "So woe to those who write the "scripture" with their own hands," was revealed regarding the People of the Book.

The narrators of the hadith are narrators from the Sahih (of Bukhari) except Abdur-Rahman ibn Alqamah, and An-Nasai, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Ijli strengthened him. And Ibn Shahin said that Ibn Mahdi said he was from the proven strong narrators.
